Key features:

- Works as a virtual drive on you computer. You can access and modify all the data
  stored in Parsec with your regular softwares just like you would on your local
  hard-drive.
- Never lose any data. Synchronization with the remote server never destroy any
  data, hence you can browse data history and recover from any point in time.
- Client-side cryptographic security. Data and metadata are only visible by you
  and the ones you choose to share with.
- Cryptographic signature. Each modification is signed by it author making trivial
  to identify modifications.
- Cloud provider agnostic. Server provides connectors for S3 and swift object
  storage.
- Simplified enrollment. New user enrollment is simple as sharing a link and a token code.
