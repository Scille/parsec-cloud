    """Provides a nursery augmented with a cancellation ordering constraint.
    If an entire service nursery becomes cancelled, either due to an
    exception raised by some task in the nursery or due to the
    cancellation of a scope that surrounds the nursery, the body of
    the nursery ``async with`` block will receive the cancellation
    first, and no other tasks in the nursery will be cancelled until
    the body of the ``async with`` block has been exited.
    This is intended to support the common pattern where the body of
    the ``async with`` block uses some service that the other
    task(s) in the nursery provide. For example, if you have::
        async with open_websocket(host, port) as conn:
            await communicate_with_websocket(conn)
    where ``open_websocket()`` enters a nursery and spawns some tasks
    into that nursery to manage the connection, you probably want
    ``conn`` to remain usable in any ``finally`` or ``__aexit__``
    blocks in ``communicate_with_websocket()``.  With a regular
    nursery, this is not guaranteed; with a service nursery, it is.
    Child tasks spawned using ``start()`` gain their protection from
    premature cancellation only at the point of their call to
    ``task_status.started()``.
