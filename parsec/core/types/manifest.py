    The raw data is identified by its `id` attribute and is aligned using the

    size is stored as `raw_size`.

    The `start` and `stop` attributes then describes the span of the actual data
    still with respect to the file addressing.

    This means the following rule applies:
        raw_offset <= start < stop <= raw_offset + raw_size
