        Operational errors have to be treated with care since they usually indicate
        that the current transaction has been rolled back. Since parsec has its own
        in-memory cache for manifests, this can lead to complicated bugs and possibly
        database corruptions (in the sense that a committed manifest might reference a
        chunk of data that has not been successfully committed). See issue #1535 for an
        example of such problem.

        If an operational error is detected we simply close the connection and invalidate
        the local database object while raising an FSLocalStorageOperationalError exception.
        This way, we force the core to create new workspace storage objects and therefore
        discarding any uncommitted data.
