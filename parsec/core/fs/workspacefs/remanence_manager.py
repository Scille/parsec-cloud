# The purpose of the remanence manager is to keep track of all the referenced blocks
# separating them between "remote only" and "local and remote" blocks.
#
# In order to do that, we need to keep track of everything that can affect this count,
# including:
# - New blocks are referenced:
#    * When a vlob is updated by someone else.
#      We use the DOWNSYNCED event to detect this case and perform a recursive sweep
#      in the remanance manager in order to list all newly referenced blocks as remote only.
#    * When a vlob is updated by our device.
#      We use the SYNCED event to detect this case. We only need to consider the events
#      corresponding to file manifests and list the newly referenced blocks as remote and local.
# - Old blocks are no longer referenced:
#    * When a vlob is updated by someone else.
#      We use the DOWNSYNCED event to detect this case and perform a recursive sweep
#      in the remanance manager in order to remove all the old blocks from both lists.
#    * When a vlob is updated by our device.
#      We use the SYNCED event to detect this case and perform a recursive sweep
#      in the remanance manager in order to remove all the old blocks from both lists.
# - A referenced block is downloaded:
#    * When a read transaction require blocks that are missing.
#      In this case we use a dedicated event.
#    * When block remanence is enabled and the manager downloads the missing blocks.
#      We can simply keep track of the downloaded blocks here
# - Refrenced blocks are discarded:
#    * This happens when the local storage for blocks has reached its limit.
#      We use a dedicated event to detect this case and remove those blocks from the remote only list.
#
# Note: we should try to avoid concurrency issue that would render the manager out of
# sync with the actual state of the workspace, although this is not a huge deal either
# as the workspace is going to be fully swept at the next loging.
