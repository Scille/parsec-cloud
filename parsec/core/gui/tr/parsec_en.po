" Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n"
" of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><a name=\"preamble\"></a>Preamble</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license\n"
"for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure\n"
"cooperation with the community in the case of network server "
"software.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are\n"
"designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By\n"
"contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your\n"
"freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it\n"
"remains free software for all its users.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n"
"price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n"
"have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n"
"them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n"
"want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n"
"free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\n"
"with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\n"
"you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\n"
"and/or modify the software.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\n"
"improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\n"
"receive widespread use, become available for other developers to\n"
"incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\n"
"encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\n"
"software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\n"
"The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\n"
"letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\n"
"source code to the public.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\n"
"ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\n"
"to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\n"
"provide the source code of the modified version running there to the\n"
"users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\n"
"a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\n"
"code of the modified version.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\n"
"published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\n"
"a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\n"
"released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\n"
"this license.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n"
"modification follow.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h3><a name=\"terms\"></a>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>\n"
"\n"
"<h4><a name=\"section0\"></a>0. Definitions.</h4>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General"
" Public\n"
"License.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to "
"other kinds\n"
"of works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed "
"under this\n"
"License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  "
"&quot;Licensees&quot; and\n"
"&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part "
"of the work\n"
"in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\n"
"exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; "
"of the\n"
"earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a "
"work based\n"
"on the Program.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, "
"without\n"
"permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\n"
"infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\n"
"computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\n"
"distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\n"
"public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that "
"enables other\n"
"parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\n"
"a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal "
"Notices&quot;\n"
"to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\n"
"feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n"
"tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\n"
"extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\n"
"work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\n"
"the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\n"
"menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h4><a name=\"section1\"></a>1. Source Code.</h4>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the"
" work\n"
"for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-"
"source\n"
"form of a work.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an "
"official\n"
"standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\n"
"interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\n"
"is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include "
"anything, other\n"
"than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\n"
"packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n"
"Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\n"
"Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n"
"implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n"
"&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential "
"component\n"
"(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n"
"(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n"
"produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form "
"means all\n"
"the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n"
"work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\n"
"control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\n"
"System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\n"
"programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\n"
"which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\n"
"includes interface definition files associated with source files for\n"
"the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\n"
"linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\n"
"such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\n"
"subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\n"
"can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\n"
"Source.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\n"
"same work.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h4><a name=\"section2\"></a>2. Basic Permissions.</h4>\n"
"\n"
"<p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\n"
"copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\n"
"conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\n"
"permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\n"
"covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\n"
"content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\n"
"rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>"
"\n"
"\n"
"<p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\n"
"convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\n"
"in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\n"
"of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\n"
"with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\n"
"the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\n"
"not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\n"
"for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\n"
"and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\n"
"your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\n"
"the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\n"
"makes it unnecessary.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h4><a name=\"section3\"></a>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-"
"Circumvention Law.</h4>\n"
"\n"
"<p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\n"
"measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n"
"11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\n"
"similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\n"
"measures.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\n"
"circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\n"
"is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\n"
"the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\n"
"modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\n"
"users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\n"
"technological measures.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h4><a name=\"section4\"></a>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h4>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\n"
"receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n"
"appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\n"
"keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\n"
"non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\n"
"keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\n"
"recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\n"
"and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h4><a name=\"section5\"></a>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h4>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\n"
"produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\n"
"terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these "
"conditions:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\n"
"<li>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n"
"    it, and giving a relevant date.</li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n"
"    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n"
"    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n"
"    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.</li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n"
"    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n"
"    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n"
"    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n"
"    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n"
"    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n"
"    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n"
"    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n"
"    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n"
"    work need not make them do so.</li>\n"
"\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\n"
"works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\n"
"and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\n"
"in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n"
"&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are "
"not\n"
"used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n"
"beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\n"
"in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\n"
"parts of the aggregate.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h4><a name=\"section6\"></a>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h4>\n"
"\n"
"<p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\n"
"of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\n"
"machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\n"
"in one of these ways:</p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\n"
"<li>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n"
"    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n"
"    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n"
"    customarily used for software interchange.</li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n"
"    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n"
"    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n"
"    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n"
"    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n"
"    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n"
"    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n"
"    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n"
"    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n"
"    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n"
"    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n"
"    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n"
"    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n"
"    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n"
"    with subsection 6b.</li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n"
"    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n"
"    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n"
"    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n"
"    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n"
"    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n"
"    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n"
"    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n"
"    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n"
"    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n"
"    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n"
"    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n"
"    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n"
"    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n"
"    charge under subsection 6d.</li>\n"
"\n"
"</ul>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\n"
"from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\n"
"included in conveying the object code work.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer "
"product&quot;, which means any\n"
"tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\n"
"or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation"
"\n"
"into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,"
"\n"
"doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\n"
"product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers "
"to a\n"
"typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\n"
"of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\n"
"actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\n"
"is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\n"
"commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\n"
"the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any "
"methods,\n"
"procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\n"
"and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from"
"\n"
"a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\n"
"suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\n"
"code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\n"
"modification has been made.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\n"
"specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\n"
"part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\n"
"User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\n"
"fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\n"
"Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\n"
"by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\n"
"if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\n"
"modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\n"
"been installed in ROM).</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a"
"\n"
"requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\n"
"for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\n"
"the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a"
"\n"
"network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\n"
"adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\n"
"protocols for communication across the network.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\n"
"in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\n"
"documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\n"

"unpacking, reading or copying.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h4><a name=\"section7\"></a>7. Additional Terms.</h4>\n"
"\n"
"<p>&quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms"

"License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\n"
"Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\n"
"be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\n"
"that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\n"
"apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\n"
"under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\n"
"this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n"
"remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\n"
"it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n"

"governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,"
"\n"
"you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further\n"

"\n"
"<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n"

"provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\n"
"finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\n"
"holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\n"
"prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n"
"reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n"
"violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n"
"received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\n"
"copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n"
"your receipt of the notice.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n"

"<h4><a name=\"section9\"></a>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having "
"Copies.</h4>\n"

"<p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n"
"run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n"
"occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n"
"to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\n"
"nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\n"
"modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\n"

"Recipients.</h4>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n"

"propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\n"

"\n"
"<p>An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring "
"control of an\n"
"organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\n"
"organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\n"
"work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n"
"transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n"
"licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\n"
"give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n"
"Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\n"
"the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>\n"

"(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\n"

"\n"
"<p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or"

"covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n"
"License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you "
"may\n"
"not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate "
