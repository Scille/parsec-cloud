    We are patching the unicorn server in order to be notified when the server should exit.

    This way we are able to communicate to the app that the SSE connections for the registered
    clients should get closed. This allows for the graceful shutdown of the server to properly
    complete, since this procedure does not cancel the ongoing tasks.

    Also note that the "force quit" feature of uvicorn (i.e sending another SIGINT while the
    server is in "should exit" mode) does not behave as expected in the sense that it won't
    cancel the ongoing tasks, as reported here:
    https://github.com/encode/uvicorn/discussions/2525#discussion-7603322

    This is why we also set a timeout for the graceful shutdown, so that the server won't
    hang indefinitely when shutting down while clients with SSE connections are still active.
