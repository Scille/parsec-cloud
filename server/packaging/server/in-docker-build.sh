# Installing the Python project is a bit tricky:
# - `pip install .` ignores dependency pinning :(
# - `poetry install` install the main project as a symlink in the virtualenv :(
# So instead we ask poetry to generate a `requirements.txt` that contains the
# pinned dependencies, then pip install this, and finally do a regular
# `pip install .` that will only install our project given all dependencies are
# already installed.

# Only keep dependencies from `main` group (i.e. the base dependencies), as other groups are for dev
poetry --directory ./server export --output requirements.txt --with=main
# Install the dependencies...
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
# ...and our project
# Compile in release mode
# Also don't bundle OpenSSL shared library (it is already in the Docker image !)
