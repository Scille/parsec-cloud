# We set `concurrency` to prevent having this workflow being run on code that is not up-to-date on a PR (a user make multiple push in a quick manner).
# But on the main branch, we don't want that behavior.
# Having the workflow run on each merge commit is something we would like, that could help us where a regression was made and missed by previous checks.
#
# For that we use `head_ref` that is only defined on `pull-request` and fallback to `run_id` (this is a counter, so it's value is unique between workflow call).
