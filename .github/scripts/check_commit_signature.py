# Commit signature is not mandatory for the repo (yet ?), however we
# want to make sure the signed commits are actually valid.
# Indeed, it seems the signature process breaks from time to time,
# see for instance commit 1e1535b010050c025d85b685e96e08db5e9cd7bb
# that is considered invalid, but has been generated 3mn after the valid

# the same key...)
