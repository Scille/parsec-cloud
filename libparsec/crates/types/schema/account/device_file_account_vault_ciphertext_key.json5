// `DeviceFileAccountVaultCiphertextKey` is a weird structure: it is stored encrypted
// as a vault item, and contains the key to decrypt a local device (itself stored
// locally on the user's machine).
//
// This is typically used on web to have a single Parsec account authentication
// allowing to store the local devices encrypted while also ensuring no other
// machine is able to connect as this device (which would be possible if the local
// device were entirely stored in the vault).
