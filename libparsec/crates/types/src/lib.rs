// Convenient dependencies we are going to need everywhere
/// ThisError vs Anyhow ?
/// `anyhow::Error` is your friend: the idea is when call a function we can have 3 outcomes:
/// - success, wrap it with `Result::Ok` and you're good ^^
/// - error we care about, your function should have a dedicated error listing those
///   errors so that caller can do pattern matching on the result
/// - error we don't care about, that's where we want to use anyhow !
///
/// Typically you should end-up with something like:
/// ```
/// #[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
/// pub enum AddMoreSpamError {
///     #[error("Not enough spam")]
///     NotEnoughSpam,
///     #[error(transparent)]
///     Internal(#[from] anyhow::Error),
/// }
/// ```
