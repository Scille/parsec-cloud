# Libparsec Serialization Format

This crate provides function-like [`procedural macros`] for generating
serialization code for libparsec protocol and data types, based on JSON schemas.

The JSON schema formats for libparsec protocol and data types are defined in
the [`json_schema`] directory. The concrete schemas can be found in the
[`/libparsec/types/schema`] and [`/libparsec/protocol/schema`] directories.

## Examples

Generate protocol commands code for all the json schemas in the
`schema/invited_cmds` directory:

```rust
parsec_protocol_cmds_family!("schema/invited_cmds");
```

Generate serialization code for the user certificate data type:

```rust
parsec_data!("schema/certif/user_certificate.json5");
```

## Internals

[`Procedural macros`] allow generating code by executing a function receiving a
stream of tokens as input and producing a stream of tokens as output to compile
into the callerâ€™s crate.
The [`syn`] and [`quote`] crates are used respectively for parsing the input
token stream and generating the output token stream. Please refer to the crates
docs to learn more about it.

## FAQ

### Why do we use a list over a map for the field values?

We use this form:

```json5
fields: [
  {
    name: foo,
    ty: String
  },
  {
    name: bar,
    ty: Integer
    introduced_in: "340"
  }
]
```

Because we also have the optional value `introduced_in` that is not always present, it prevents us to use the following form:


```json5
fields: {
  foo: String,
  bar: Integer
}
```

We are also limited by `miniserde` that does not accept a different form for the same field (`string | object`)

The middle ground would be

```json5
fields: {
  foo: {
    ty: String
  },
  bar: {
    ty: Integer,
    introduced_in: "340"
  }
}
```

But there is no much gain with the original form
