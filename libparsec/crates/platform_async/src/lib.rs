// We don't expose `futures::select` macro & co for the moment: let's try to use only our
// custom `select2_biased` macro and `futures::future::select` instead.

/// Poor's man version of `tokio::select!`, be careful when using in loop (see fused future) !
///
/// The typical intended use for this is to add timeout/cancel signal support
/// to an asynchronous operation.
///
/// The reasons for this macro are:
/// - `tokio::select!` is not available on web.
/// - `futures::select!` requires the futures to be fused, which is cumbersome and doesn't
///   do much (see https://users.rust-lang.org/t/why-doesnt-tokio-select-require-fusedfuture/46975/7).
/// - Doing a select on two futures is the most common case.
///
/// This select is biased given it is implemented with [futures::future::select], so first
/// future is prefered on simultaneous completion.
/// For instance, a loop with a select on a queue first and then a cancel signal will
/// struggle to stop if the queue is always full.
