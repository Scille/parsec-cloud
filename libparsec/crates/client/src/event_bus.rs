    // Server connection related events.
    // ***********************************************************************

    // Client-server communication is divided into two parts:
    // - Client commands sent to the server through an RPC-like mechanism.
    // - Server events sent to the client through a Server-Sent Events (SSE) mechanism.
    //
    // In practice we have a single SSE connection handled by the connection monitor, and
    // multiple concurrent RPC commands depending on what is going on in the client (e.g.
    // data synchronization, reading a file not in cache, etc.).
    //
    // On top of that, low-level details about the server connection are handled by the
    // reqwest library (see `libparsec_client_connection` implementation), hence we have no
    // guarantee on the number of physical TCP connections being used to handle RPC and SSE.
    //
    // However what we know is 1) RPC and SSE connect to the same server and 2) server
    // and client both support HTTP/2. Hence we can expect all connections to be multiplexed
    // over a single physical TCP connection.
    //
    // With this in mind, the choice has been to have the connection-related events only
    // fired by the connection monitor: if a RPC command fails due to server disconnection,
    // it is very likely the SSE connection will also fail right away.

    /// The SSE connection with the server has been established.

    /// This event is fired by `Client::accept_tos` when the TOS have been accepted.
    /// It's most likely the server will now accept the next connection attempt.
    ///
    /// This event is used to signify to the connection monitor that it should try
