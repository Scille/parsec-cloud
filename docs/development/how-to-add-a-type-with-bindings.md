# How to add a type with its python bindings

1. Define it in the `libparsec/crates/types`
2. Implement (or derive) Debug, Copy, Clone, Hash, Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Eq, FromStr, ToString
3. Use #[serde(rename_all = "SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE")] (because python naming conventions are different)
4. Add it in `server/src/lib.rs` to make it visible to python
5. Expose it in `server/src/` using a macro starting with `gen_py_wrapper_class` depending on your use case
6. Define the python class typing in `server/parsec/_parsec_pyi/` (note that the `protocol` folder contains autogenerated typing). The file name should be the same as the one you edited in `server/src/` (except for the extension)
