The goal of this document is to cover all the necessary steps to add an api route in the current architecture.

## Schema generation

In `libparsec/crates/protocol/schema/xxxxxx_cmds/dummy.json5


```json5
[
    {
        "major_versions": [
            4
        ],
        "req": {
            "cmd": "dummy",
            "fields": [
                {
                    "name": "dummy_field",
                    "type": "String"
                }
            ]
        },
        "reps": [
            {
                "status": "dummy_rep_with_fields",
                "fields": [
                    {
                        "name": "dummy_rep_field",
                        "type": "String"
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                "status": "dummy_rep_without_fields",
            }
        ]
    }
]

```
For a full description of the accepted format see [the parsing/generating script](../../misc/gen_protocol_typings.py).

> Note that the files are .json5. This is to allow for comments inside these files. But the parser we are using only supports .json files and we're removing the comments ourselves. So don't use any other specific feature of the json5 format (trailing commas, I'm looking at you ðŸ‘€).

Then run the following scripts
- `python make.py r` (see [here](../../make.py)) to rebuild the bindings (use option `i` to install). The modified files are :
    - `server/parsec/_parsec_pyi/protocol/__init__.pyi`
    - `server/parsec/_parsec_pyi/protocol/xxxxxx_cmds/v4/__init__.pyi`
    - `server/tests/common/rpc.py`
- `python misc/gen_protocol_typings.py` (see [here](../../misc/gen_protocol_typings.py)) to generate the .pyi files and some helpers for the tests. The generated code is in `/target`


## Serialization tests

After bindings generation, the serialization tests become required.

In `libparsec/crates/protocol/tests/xxxxx_cmds/v4/dummy.rs` for each req and rep variant, there must be a a public function named req or rep _ the variant name. You'll have this kind of error.

```shell
error[E0425]: cannot find function `rep_dummy_rep_without_fields` in module `dummy`
  --> libparsec/crates/protocol/tests/serialization.rs:15:1
   |
15 | protocol_cmds_tests!("schema/xxxxx_cmds");
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ not found in `dummy`
```

As for the content the goal is to go from bytes to the tested type, assert it's ok and back to bytes and assert it's adding up. On how to generate the bytes see [here](generate_blob.md) and [there](../rfcs/1009-hexstring-format.md)


## Server side implementation

### Optional: the route introduces a new component

In `server/parsec/components` you define a base component. It will need to have the corresponding memory component and postgresql component in their respective folder.

Add your component to `class Backend` in `server/parsec/backend.py`

Add it to the `components_factory` both in `server/parsec/components/memory/factory.py` and `server/parsec/components/postgresql/factory.py`


### Defining the route

In a component (maybe the one defined just before), you'll need to define this kind of function.

```python
    @api
    async def api_dummy(
        self,
        client_ctx: xxxxxClientContext,
        req: xxxxx_cmds.latest.dummy.Req,
    ) -> xxxxx.latest.dummy.Rep:
        match await self.do_dummy():
        case None:
            return invited_cmds.latest.dummy.Rep()
        case DummyBadOutcome.DUMMY_SPECIFIC_ERROR:
            return invited_cmds.latest.dummy.RepDummyRepWithoutFields()
        case DummyBadOutcome.ORGANIZATION_NOT_FOUND:
            client_ctx.organization_not_found_abort()
```

This function will mostly contain error management logic. The component will also contain a generic method, that will be overrode in the memory and postgresql implementations.

> Note that some common error like organization not found have helpers that return the appropriate error.

```python
    async def do_dummy(
        self,
        # parameters found in client_ctx and req
    ) -> None | DummyBadOutcome:
        raise NotImplementedError
```

Your errors must inherit from `BadOutcomeEnum`

The real implementation will happen in a Memory or postgresql component.

```python
class MemoryDummyComponent(BaseDummyComponent):
    def __init__(self, data: MemoryDatamodel, event_bus: EventBus) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self._data = data
        self._event_bus = event_bus

    @override
    async def do_dummy(
        self,
        # parameters found in client_ctx and req
    ) -> None | DummyBadOutcome:
        print("There are ",len(self._data.organizations), " organizations here.")
```


## Server tests

In import the new test file in `server/tests/api_v4/xxxxx/init.py`. It must be named `test_{new command name}`

Start a new testbed

`test_each_cmd_req_rep_has_dedicated_test` will fail if a test per output are missing


## Client side
