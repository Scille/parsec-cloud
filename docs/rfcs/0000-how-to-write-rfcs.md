  - [How to write markdown](#how-to-write-markdown)

  - [Suggested vscode extensions](#suggested-vscode-extensions)

## How to name the rfc file

We use a specific filename format for RFC files: `<id:04d>-<title:s>.md`

- Where `id` is a serial number, it should be greater than the previous ids used
  > If the greater previous id used is `42` the next id should be `43`.
- Where `title` should be the title used in the document
  - The title could change a little
  - Use the `kebab-case`
  - only use alpha numeric character `[0-9a-zA-Z]`

## How to write markdown

If you never written `markdown`, take a look at <https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/>

## Link a RFC in another RFC

To link another RFC in another RFC

```markdown
[RFC-NNNN](<RFC-FILENAME>)
```

> Where `<RFC-FILENAME>` is the filename of the linked rfc, relative to the rfc.

## Link a github issue or pull request

If you want to link an issue or a pull request in the RFC use the following format:

- For issue

  ```markdown
  [ISSUE-NNNN](https://github.com/foo/bar/issue/NNNN)
  ```

- For pull request

  ```markdown
  [PR-NNNN](https://github.com/foo/bar/pull/NNNN)
  ```

## Suggested vscode extensions

I recommend using these vscode extensions:

- `yzhang.markdown-all-in-one`: Provide completion, some shortcut & command to simplify writing markdown.
- `DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint`: Add a markdown linter to provide a base style when writing markdown file.
- `bierner.markdown-footnotes`: Allow to render the `footnotes` on the preview.
