Parsec allows you to easily share your work and data in the cloud in total
privacy thanks to end-to-end cryptographic security.

Key features:

- Works as a virtual drive on you computer. You can access and modify all the data
  stored in Parsec with your regular software just like you would on your local
  hard-drive.
- Never lose any data. Encrypted data are synchronized with the remote server
  that never destroys anything, hence you can browse data history and recover
  from any point in time.
- Client-side cryptographic security. Data and metadata are only visible by you
  and the ones you choose to share with.
- Cryptographic signature. Each modification is signed by its author making its
  identification trivial.
- Simplified enrollment. New user enrollment is as simple as sharing a link and
  a token code.
- Easy to self-host.
