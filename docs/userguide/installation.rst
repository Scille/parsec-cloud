Install Parsec client
=====================

Windows
-------

Windows installer is available at the latest stable version on `parsec.cloud <https://parsec.cloud/get-parsec>`_. Otherwise, it is possible to download a specific Parsec version on `GitHub <https://github.com/Scille/parsec/releases/latest>`_, for example to make Parsec work on a 32 bits computer (installers named ``parsec-vX.Y.Z-win32-setup.exe``).


Linux
-----

Parsec is available on Snap:

If you are familiar with Snap, you may notice that Parsec snap is provided in classic mode (i.e. without sandbox). This is needed because Parsec needs `Fuse <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace>`_ to mount your data as a virtual directory, which is not allowed by the Snap sandbox.


.. note::

    You can install the snap from the command line by doing:

    .. code-block:: shell

        sudo snap install parsec --classic



MacOS
-----

MacOS (10.15, >= 11.0) installer is available as a DMG installer on `GitHub <https://github.com/Scille/parsec/releases/latest>`_ (installer named ``parsec-vX.Y.Z-macos-amd64.dmg``).

The MacOS version requires `macFUSE <https://osxfuse.github.io/>`_ to be installed, which can be troublesome on Big Sur and Monterey. See `this discussion <https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/814>`_ about it and the OS' limitations.

.. note::

    Parsec uses userspace filesystems for a smooth integration of created repositories and ease of access to stored files.
    This core feature is enabled by macFUSE, and is required to have the native experience we aim for.


MacFUSE installation on MacOS 13
********************************

From the `macFUSE <https://osxfuse.github.io/>`_ website, you can find the latest version to download at the indicated location.

Open the ``.dmg`` file and follow its instructions to install.
If the opening fails, two options are available in `System Settings > Privacy and Security`: either check the `App Store and identified developers` box, or click `Open Anyway` if you don't want to change this setting, which will need to be done once to open the ``.dmg``, and possibly once more to start the installer.

A reboot might be prompted then to finalize the installation.

MacFUSE installation on MacOS versions 12 and lower
***************************************************

From the `macFUSE <https://osxfuse.github.io/>`_ website, you can find the latest version to download at the indicated location.

Open the ``.dmg`` file and follow its instructions to install. If the opening fails, check the `App Store and identified developers` box in System Preferences > Security & Privacy:

To change this setting, click the lock first which will require admin rights.

Once the installation is done, a `System Extension Updated` window will pop up. Click `Open Security Preferences`, and click the lock, then click `Allow`:

Finally, reboot your Mac to complete the installation.
