Security best practices
-----------------------

To avoid losing access to your data you should always:

- :ref:`Add multiple devices <doc_userguide_manage_devices>` to access Parsec
- :ref:`Share your workspaces <doc_userguide_parsec_workspaces_share>` with
  other users

.. caution::

  Strong cryptographic security prevents data recovery. This means that if you
  lose access to your computer, or cannot log in for any reason, there is no way
  to recover your data.
