"This feature is not part of the Parsec revocation system, but a way for "
"system administrators to temporarily block users from connecting to the "
"server while waiting for organization administrators to actually revoke "
"them. It is exposed as an HTTP route that requires the administration token. "
"This way, it is possible for existing directory services to automatically "
"freeze users that have been removed from the directory."

msgid ""
"There is a subtle difference between the two ways to identify a user. At any "
"given time, an email address can be used to uniquely identify a non-revoked "
"user from a given organization. In contrast, a Parsec user ID identifies "
"uniquely any user from all organizations in the Parsec server, including "
"revoked users. This means that over time, an email address can identify "
"different Parsec users with different Parsec IDs, even from the same "
"organization."
msgstr ""

#: ../../adminguide/frozen_users.rst:101
msgid ""
"The frozen status configured by the `POST` method is specifically associated "
"with the Parsec user ID, regardless of the identification method used in the "
"request body. This has the following consequence: if a user is revoked and "
"then a new user is created with the same email address, the frozen status "
"will **not** be applied to the new user."
